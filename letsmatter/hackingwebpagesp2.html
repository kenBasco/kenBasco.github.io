    <h2>Recap<h2>

    <p>
      In the previous article, you learned how to look at the code
      of a webpage in your browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this article, you are going to <strong>download webpages</strong> from your browser. Then,
      you are going to <strong>edit</strong> the webpage's code in a <strong>text editor</strong> of your choice.
    </p>

    <h2>Downloading Webpages</h2>

    <p>
      <strong> Right-click on this webpage. </strong>

    and 'Print...', 'View Page source'" >

       This webpage is now saved on your computer as an html file.
     </p>

     <h2>Opening your downloaded webpage in a <strong>text editor</strong></h2>

     <p>
       Sorry, I have to explain what a text editor is first.
     </p>

     <h2>What is a <strong>text editor</strong>? </h2>

     <p>
       A text editor is an application used to change the source code of a text file.
       Every file is made of a series of instructions as to what the file does.
       The file extension (the thing that comes after the name of a file after
       the dot '.') usually denotes the type of file, and the type of programming language
       the file it is written in.
     </p>

     <p>

       For example, this file is called "hackingwebpagesp2.html". This file is
       written in html. I really want to explain what html is, but right now
       we're here to hack web pages, more specifically, by the use of a text editor.
       Below are examples of text editors we can use to edit this file.
     </p>

     </a>

     <p>
       ...AND MANY MORE !
       <br>
       From right to left we have Notepad, TextEdit, Notepad++, and Atom.
       I reccomending downloading one of the last two, because you get fancy features
       like colored text highlighting for special keywords and indentation outlines, which makes things easier
       to read but that's not <em>too</em> important right now.

     </p>
     <p>
       <br>
       If you're on PC, you already have Notepad.
       <br>
       If you're on Mac, you have TextEdit.
       <br>
       Use one of these programs to open this webpage you just saved.
     </p>

    <h2>Opening your webpage in a text editor (continued)</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Open the text editor program of your choice. </strong>
      In this case, I'm going to be using notepad.
