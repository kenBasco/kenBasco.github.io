  <h1>How To "Hack" Webpages Part 1</h1>

  <h3>What is Hacking?</h3>

  <p>
    I feel that a lot of non-technical people or anyone born before 1995 think
    that hacking is the use of esoteric technical knowledge to steal information or
    make machines do things outside of their design. While this is a fiction of Hollywood, they are not
    entirely wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the part of the class where I ask everyone what they
    think hacking is. There's usually a 5 second pause of silence, then 2 or 3 of you raise their hand
    because most of you are either tired or
    don't want to look too eager on the first day.
  </p>

  <p>
    But thankfully, this is an online class, so I'll spare you the ordeal of collaborative
    learning by telling you what it means in this context.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em> Hacking is the use of technincal knowledge to achieve a desired
    outcome. </em>
  </p>

  <h3> Your First Hacking Activity </h3>

  <p>
    Sometimes, I will ask you to download and edit webpages.
    We're going to start by reading the code in this web page.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong> Right-click on this webpage. </strong>
  </p>

  alt="a cursor on a webpage, with a drop-down menu spilling out of its tail
  the drop-down menu is a box with an array of messages stacked on top of
  eachother. From top to bottom it reads: 'Back', 'Forward', 'Reload', 'Save as...',
  and 'Print...', 'View Page source'" >


  <p>
    <strong>
      Select "view webpage"  This should open a
      new tab in your browser.
    </strong>
</p>
  </p>

  alt=" the cursor tickles the dropdown box highlighting the 'View Page source' option" >


  <p>
    <strong>
      In the new tab, read through the code.
    </strong>
  </p>

  alt = "a portion of the browser window with two tabs open, both saying 'Downloading_Webpages...'
  peaking out. The page source code is displayed underneath">


  <p>
    <strong>
      There should be a HIDDEN MESSAGE inside the code.
      Follow its directions. When you are done, go to the next lesson.
    </strong>
  </p>


  <!--

  !~~~ HIDDEN MESSAGE ~~~!

  Holyfuck, (i can't say fuck in class so I'm saying it here)

  You did it! I knew you could. It doesn't even matter how you did it.
  You could have asked a friend to do it or you googled it or you used context
  clues to imitate a fellow classmate.

  The point is, you did something. It doesn't really matter
  how, just that you took the journey unapologetically of form nor circumstance.

  I'm so proud of you.

  But what does it mean to you? How do you fit into this personally? That's up
  to you.

  DIRECTIONS :

  1) Go to the canvas course page. Go to the RE: SPECIAL DIRECTIONS discussion
  assignment under the "Webpages, amirite?" Module.

  2) Think about your favourite animal.

  3) Follow the directions below:

  IF YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL IS A DOG, CAT, BIRD, GERBIL, OR HAMSTER
    REPLY your favourite COLOR in the DISCUSSION post.

  IF your favourite animal is NOT a DOG, CAT, GERBIL, or HAMSTER
    REPLY with your favourite ANIMAL in the DISCUSSION post.

  ALSO IF you ever wanted to be that animal at some point
    REPLY WHY you wanted to be that animal in the DISCUSSION post.

  !!! MYTHICAL CREATURES ARE ALLOWED !!! >:^U

  !~~~ HIDDEN MESSAGE END ~~~!
