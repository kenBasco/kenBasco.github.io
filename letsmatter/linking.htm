    <h1>Going to other Webpages</h1>
    <p>
      Other than filling up pages with content, and styling them, we can also send users to other pages, to see other things on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>Such as:</p>
    <!--An unordered list-->
    <ul>
        <!--
            Each list item is an <a>nchor tag
            Anchor tags let users hop to other webpages
        -->
        <li>
          <!--
              The anchor tags are between the message "A picture".
              This makes that message a clickable link
          -->
          <a href="https://cdn.britannica.com/48/94548-050-A37B3B8F/Platypus.jpg">A picture</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <!--
              The anchor tag has the attribute "href" inside of it.
              Here, href is assigned to a web link between quotation marks.
          -->

        </li>
        <li>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9XTqQbuavI">Some sounds</a>
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Your turn, take me someplace nice</h2>

    <a href="#">SOMEPLACE NICE</a> <!-- Try changing the "pound" to a weblink -->

    <hr>

    <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>

    <p>Go on, it's been a while. Try making the "SOMEPLACE NICE" link take your user somewhere. Look through the code to see how to do it.</p>

    <h2>THINGS TO THINK ABOUT</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>
      The blue underlined links are a bit cliche, what can we do to make them look different, but still function like links?
      </li>
      <li>
      How can we go to other pages hosted on the same website? Or other pages on your machine?
      </li>
      <li>
      What is the difference between links and butons? How are they similar?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Doesn't work, you can play with it to make it take you somewhere else-->
    <a class="next" href="#">Next ==> </a>
