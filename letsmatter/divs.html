    <!--
      HIDDEN DIRECTIONS
      =============
      1) Change the font-size of the text in dark-divisor by editing it in the style selector.
      2) Try giving the first div on this page the "tomato" styling.
      3) Surround ANY group of elements on this page with the dark-divisor styling.
    -->

    <div class =""> <!-- Give this div the "tomato" styling -->
      <h1>Divs, as in Divisors</h1>
      <p>Previously, we learned how to style different elements by selecting them by name. We also learned how to change elements without changing other elements that share the same tag.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, we want to group elements together. We want to do this for the following reasons:</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
      <li>creating a different visual aesthetic for a section of the page</li>
      <li>associate elements with eachother regardless of tag</li>
      <li>and more (i couldn't think of anything else lol, feel free to add on in the discussion XD )</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We do this by:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>creating a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag</li>
      <li>giving the div tag a name</li>
      <li>selecting the div, and applying styling to it.</li>
    </ol>

    <!--
      DEMO:
      ===============
      Any elements you want to group is surrounded by <div> tags.
      There are three <p>aragraph elements inside this div.
    -->
    <div class="dark-divisor"> <!--This div is given the name "dark-divisor"-->
      <p>This sentence is inside a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>isor. </p>
      <p>You can't tell because the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags are written inside the code. </p>
      <p>What color is it? It can't tell.</p>
    </div>

    <hr>

    <!--(Please) Style these directions-->
    <div class="">
      <h2> DIRECTIONS </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Open this page's code and follow its hidden directions.</li>
        <li>When done, come back and do the final task below: </li>
        <li>These directions are surrounded by <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags. Give the div its own name and style it as you wish.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
