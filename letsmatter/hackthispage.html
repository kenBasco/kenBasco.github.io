                Download this page and read through the code's comments saying
               what each type of element does.
            </p>

            <p>
                HTML comments are in the form of: < !-- this is a comment  -- > <br>
                anything in between < !-- and -- > is ignored by the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                THEN in your code editor, do the following activity:
            </p>

            <h2> ACTIVITY </h2>
            <p> Try to accumulate <em>13 pts</em> : </p>
            <ul>
                  <li> <em> (+1 pts)</em> EDIT existing html elements. (change what it says, content, etc.; i.e., make the heading element say: "Kenneth Basco eats poopy butts")</li>
                  <li> <em> (+1 pts)</em> SWAP the order of existing html elements on this page (i.e., put the Activity at the top, put a sub heading underneath the image, move the paragraph to the bottom) </li>
                  <li> <em> (+1 pts) </em> Use of <em>italics</em> or <strong>bolding</strong> text. </li>
                  <li> <em> (+3 pts) </em> CREATE ONE of the following elements: </li>
                      <ul> <!-- EXAMPLE OF ELEMENTS WITHIN ELEMENTS -->
                          <li> paragraph (i.e., found poem, comment, copypasta, etc.) </li>
                          <li> image  (i.e., selfie, meme, something you saw outside, in your room, etc.) </li>
                          <li> list (i.e., list of favourite movies/shows, reasons to get out of bed, reasons you don't like this class, shopping list, how to tutorial) </li>
                      </ul>
                  <li><em>(+10 pts)</em> Add content to this page explaining what you did/changes made, and your <strong>scoring.</strong></li>
                  <li>
                    <strong><em>(x2 pt multiplier)</em> for experimentation and creativity</strong>
                    (i.e, put elements inside elements,
                    explain what you did using images or lists,
                    nonsensical content,
                    sensical content,
                    etc.).
                  </li>

            </ul>

            <p><strong>It is possible to score multiple birds with one element. ;^) </strong></p>

            <p>When done, save your html file and <strong>UPLOAD it in the "Upload your Hacked Page" Assignment </strong> under the "Webpages, amirite?" module in canvas.</p>
