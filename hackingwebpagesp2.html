    <h1> How to "Hack" webpages Part 2 <h1> <!-- HERE--->
    <h3>Recap<h3>

    <p>
      In the previous article, you learned how to look at the code
      of a webpage in a new browser.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this article, you are going to <strong>download webpages</strong> from your browser. Then,
      you are going to <strong>edit</strong> the webpage's code in a <strong>text editor</strong> of your choice.
    </p>

    <h3>Downloading Webpages</h3>

    <p>
      <strong> Right-click on this webpage. </strong>
    </p>

    alt="a cursor on a webpage, with a drop-down menu spilling out of its tail
    the drop-down menu is a box with an array of messages stacked on top of
    eachother. From top to bottom it reads: 'Back', 'Forward', 'Reload', 'Save as...',
    and 'Print...', 'View Page source'" >

    <p>
      <strong>
        Select "Save Page as..."
      </strong>
    </p>

    <img src=""
    alt=" the dropdown box highlighting the 'Save Page as...'
     option" >

    <p>
      <strong>
        This should prompt your computer's file manager, where you can choose where you want your
        downloaded file to stay. I'm going to put mine in the SMATTERING WORKSPACE.
      </strong>
    </p>

    <img src=""
    alt = "The File manager window is open. At the top it indicates it is in
    the 'This PC > Destop > SMATTERING WORKSPACE' directory.">

     <p>
       <strong>
         Click "Save".
       </strong>
     </p>

     <img src=""
     alt = "The Mouse cursor is on the 'save' button at the bottom of the
     filemanager window">

     <br>
     <br>

     <p>
       This webpage is now saved on your computer as an html file.
     </p>

     <h3>Opening your downloaded webpage in a <strong>text editor</strong></h3>

     <p>
       Sorry, I have to explain what a text editor is first.
     </p>

     <h3>What is a <strong>text editor</strong>? </h3>

     <p>
       A text editor is an application used to change the source code of a text file.
       Every file is made of a series of instructions as to what the file does.
       The file extension (the thing that comes after the name of a file after
       the dot '.') usually denotes the type of file, and the type of programming language
       the file it is written in.
     </p>

     <p>

       For example, this file is called "hackingwebpagesp2.html". This file is
       written in html. I really want to explain what html is, but right now
       we're here to hack web pages, more specifically, by the use of a text editor.
       Below are examples of text editors we can use to edit this file.
     </p>

       <img src="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/images/logo.svg" alt="notepad++" style="width:130px;height:130px;border:13;">

     </a>

     <p>
       ...AND MANY MORE !
       <br>
       From right to left we have Notepad, TextEdit, Notepad++, and Atom.
       I reccomending downloading one of the last two, because you get fancy features
       like colored text for special keywords and indentation outlines, which makes things easier
       to read but that's not <em>too</em> important right now.

     </p>
     <p>
       <br>
       If you're on PC, you already have Notepad.
       <br>
       If you're on Mac, you have TextEdit.
       <br>
       Use one of these programs to open this webpage you just saved.
