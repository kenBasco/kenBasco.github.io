        An Analogy on getting dressed

      </h3>

      <p>
        I have trouble getting dressed sometimes. <br>
        The pants I want to wear for the day is somewhere in my room
        and other times it's hanging in the bathroom. <br>
        I can't even
        remember which pants I left my wallet and keys in, so I end up
        hunting every article of clothing in my house to find it.
        <br>
        Then, I have to put my pants, wallet, keys, shirt, etc all together.

      </p>


      <p>
          I feel like it would have been

        <em>
        really nice if I had everything in one place.
        </em>

      </p>

      <h3>

        Programming is like getting dressed

      </h3>

      <p>
        When you write your code in all these different files, they sometimes need to
        talk to eachother. As a programmer, it becomes difficult keeping track of what <strong>file</strong> (clothing)
        is in what <strong>folder</strong> (room), let alone getting dressed when
        all your clothes are in different places.
      </p>

      <!---

      You know, maybe I shouldve used people instead of
      clothing in this analogy, Like people talking to eachother
      in different rooms. Oh well.

      <h3>

        Setting Up Your Workspace

      </h3>



      <p>
        <strong>Create a new folder on your computer. </strong>
        This is going to be your workspace.
        It can be anywhere, as long as it is
        easy to remember. Personally, I'm going to put my folder on my Desktop.
      </p>

        Throughout this class, you are going to be downloading, editing, and testing

        This workspace folder can act as a place to keep all your class files.

      <p>
         Some of these files compliment one another, in that they need to talk to eachother.
      </p>


      <p>
        So, your workspace is a nice little room you can put them in to have a chat !
