<p>
  In the last article, we learned how to style HTML elements by selecting them
in the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag.
</p>

<p>
  We do this using the following syntax:
</p>

<pre>
  <code>
[ELEMENT]
{
  [PROPERTY] : [VALUE];
}
  </code>
</pre>

<ul>

  <li>
    We first write the name of the ELEMENT, following curly braces. Inside those
    curly braces, we write a statement that change how this element is displayed.
  </li>
  <li>
  Each statement starts with the PROPERTY name, which is <strong>what we want to change
  about the element. </strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Then we write a colon.
  </li>
  <li>
    After the colon, we write the VALUE, or <strong> how we want to change the element. </strong>
  </li>
</ul>
