    <h1>How to select Specific elements</h1>
    <h2>Not like Other Paragraphs</h2>
    <p>
        As you can see, there are more than one paragraph in this article.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we change the properties of the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag on line
        7 of this code, it changes how every paragraph (or all text between the
        &lt;p&gt; tags) on this page looks.
    </p>

      <!--
        we can give this <p> tag a specific name
        to differentiate it from the other p elements

        we do this by adding "class=" inside the <p> tag
        then assigning it a name within quotation marks ""

        in this case, we name this <p>aragraph "different"
        different has its own selector on line 10 of this code
      -->
    <p class="different">
        But what if we want this paragraph to look different than the others?
    </p>
